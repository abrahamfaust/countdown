# countdown
a simple count down


This is a simple countdown that starts from today and counts down to a specific date. 
Please note that the date is set to be 3 months from now to keep the website running at all times. 
If you want to use this countdown, you should use the comment 'targetdate'. To change the date, you must go to the script page and change the 'targetDate' in the 'startCountdown' function. 

Additionally, the countdown displays the remaining days in binary format.
